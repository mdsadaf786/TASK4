#DESCRIPTION : 
CODTECH C LANGUAGE INTERNSHIP TASKS – PROJECT DESCRIPTION This repository contains the completed solution for all four internship tasks assigned by CODTECH as part of the C Programming Language internship. The internship primarily focused on practical implementation of core C programming concepts, including file handling, data structures, compiler design basics, and data compression techniques. Each task was carefully designed to enhance hands-on coding skills and provide real-world problem-solving experience in the C programming language.

Task 4: Run-Length Encoding (RLE) – Compression & Decompression This task involves writing a program that performs Run-Length Encoding (RLE) – a simple and effective form of lossless data compression. The program accepts a string (e.g., "aaabbbc") and compresses it into a form like "a3b3c1". It also supports decompression, reconstructing the original string from the compressed version.

In task4.c, the compression logic counts consecutive repeated characters and prints the character followed by the count. The decompression logic reads pairs of characters and counts and repeats them accordingly. This exercise provides a real-world example of how data compression works in text and image file formats (like .bmp, .pcx, etc.).
